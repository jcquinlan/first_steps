            <h3>What Is Craniosacral Therapy?</h3>
            <p>CST is a gentle, hands-on method of evaluating and enhancing the functioning of a system in the body called the craniosacral system. It is comprised of the membranes, bones and cerebrospinal fluid that surround and protect the brain and spinal cord.  The cranial bones have been found to be slightly moveable with a palpable movement or rhythm of their own.</p>
            <p>Using a soft touch generally no greater than 5 grams, or about the weight of a

nickel, practitioners release restrictions in the craniosacral system to improve the 

functioning of the central nervous system.</p>
            <p>By complementing the body's natural healing processes, CST is increasingly used as a preventive health measure for its ability to bolster resistance to disease, improve tissue mobility and function and is effective for a wide range of medical problems associated with pain and dysfunction.</p>

            <h3>How Do Babies Benefit From CST?</h3>
            <p>Sometimes, experiences during pregnancy and delivery can produce changes in
the newborn that can be addressed with CST. Position in utero can affect 
development/alignment of muscles and bones.  During childbirth, the baby can 
have compressions of the spine and base of skull due to a prolonged or difficult 
delivery that can compromise the Central Nervous System. 
Babies who have trouble with initial sucking, colic or breathing problems may be 
exhibiting compression of some cranial bones. Babies who are difficult to calm 
may benefit from simple treatment that relieves compressions or restrictions.</p>
           <p>Torticollis, (head tilt or head rotation to one side), is one of those conditions where CST can help unwind torsion in the spine and allow for balance and alignment of the head and neck. Plagiocephaly, (flat areas on head), can be relieved by releasing the sutures that have become restricted allowing the head to grow into itâ€™s natural, balanced shape.</p>
           <p>Tongue-tie, lip-tie or tethered oral-tissue is another issue that CST can help with.  When a baby has tongue and/or lip tie, it causes restrictions in movement that can make breastfeeding very difficult.  Tongue and/or Lip tie can interfere with the breastfeeding.  It can cause poor latch, inability to latch,  fatigue during feeds, poor weight gain, clicking during a feed or nipple pain.  CST uses gentle, soft tissue manual therapy techniques to help maximize baby's tongue function and improve breastfeeding.</p>
           <p>Sometimes with just a few sessions, babies will eat, sleep, and rest easier. 
Change is made quickly with newborns due to the gentleness and non-invasive 
techniques of CranioSacral Therapy.</p>
