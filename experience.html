                    <p>"I took my daughter in for her routine checkup when the pediatrician recommended physical
    therapy for torticollis. We had quite a few options and chose First Steps. I am so glad we did;
    Carol was fantastic! She is very professional and very welcoming. She made us feel at home, and
    always told me exactly what she was working on, so I could be involved in my infant's care."
